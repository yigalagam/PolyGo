# PolyGo
PolyGo is a nested polygon pattern generator. It creates geometrical patterns of nested polygons using a simple principle: A polygon, the base polygon of the pattern, is drawn, followed by another, similar polygon, which is reduced in size and rotated relative to the first one, so that all vertices of the smaller polygon touch the sides of the larger polygon. The second polygon is followed by a third, yet smaller, rotated polygon, and so forth. PolyGo uses this technique to create beautiful patterns of dazzling colors and shapes, which can be saved and exported to other graphic applications. Enhance your website, create eye-popping artwork or use as a teaching tool for math and geometry.

To run PolyGo without having to compile it, just download the jar file and open it directly, or install it on your computer using the executable installer. Requires Java 1.6 or higher.
